# CryptoPriceTracker

Cryptocurrency price tracker for Bitcoin and Ethereum made using Python3. Imported CryptoCompare API to extract live market data. 
Files are saved into a .command file as to make them an executable that can be run on any system.

Prices are updated every second according to data that can be fetched at the given moment.

Prices are shown in United States Dollar(USD), Bitcoin(BTC), British Pounds(GBP) and Singapore Dollar(SGD).
These 4 currencies being beneficial to me as USD is the standard currency quoted, BTC to know the comparison BTC is to ETH, GBP is the country that I live and study in as of 2022, and SGD is my home currency.
